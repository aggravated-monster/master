# Super Mario Bros Reinforcement Learning - Phase 1
This is an adaptation of Sourish07 original code (https://github.com/Sourish07/Super-Mario-Bros-RL)


In this phase, we apply object detection to each observation, and instead of the whole frame, only feed
the positions of the recognised objects to the network.
